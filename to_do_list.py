Let's create a to do list. I know, thrilling. 
Ask the user for 5 items to put into their to do list.
Once the user has provided 5 items, display the list back

# Example: len(my_to_dos)

# Now ask for user input, and remember we want **5 items**!!!
# How can we repeat asking the user to give us all the items?
