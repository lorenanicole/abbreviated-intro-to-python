Let's create a to do dictionary. 

Ask the user for 5 items to put into their to do dictionary.
Each task should have a corresponding number (the key).
Once the user has provided 5 tasks, display each task number
and task description back to the user.

# HINT: You can see how many items are in the 
# dictionary by using the built-in function len!
# Example: len(my_to_dos)

# Now ask for user input, and remember we want **5 task numbers and 
# task descriptions**!!! You can create the number yourself, 
# just ask the user for the task description. How can we repeat asking 
# the user to give us all the items?

print "Fantastic! Here is the list of things you have to do today:"

# Again, how can we repeat something? But this time
# it doesn't have to be tied to a specific condition. 
# We just want to see everything in our dictionary, 
# both the task number and task description .
